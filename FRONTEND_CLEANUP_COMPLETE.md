# Frontend Cleanup - Removal of Dummy/Fake Buttons

## Completed Changes

### 1. AppSidebar Component Cleanup
- **Removed inactive navigation links**: Eliminated links to `/search`, `/library`, `/create-playlist`, and `/liked` that weren't implemented
- **Simplified sidebar**: Now only shows the "Home" section which is actually functional
- **Made "Get Premium" button functional**: Connected it to the subscription plans display instead of being a dummy button
- **Conditional rendering**: Only shows upgrade banner for free users
- **Removed unused imports**: Cleaned up NavLink and unnecessary icons

### 2. App.tsx Route Cleanup
- **Removed unused routes**: Deleted `/search` and `/library` routes that just redirected to home
- **Simplified routing**: Now only contains functional routes (home, auth, subscription pages, 404)

### 3. Home.tsx Content Cleanup
- **Removed "Coming Soon" button**: Eliminated the disabled "Generate AI Music (Coming Soon)" button from the header
- **Updated empty state**: Changed message to focus on upgrading to premium instead of "coming soon" features
- **Removed dummy button from empty state**: Eliminated the disabled button in the empty music library state

### 4. TrackCard Component Cleanup
- **Removed fake action buttons**: Eliminated non-functional like button and dropdown menu
- **Simplified interface**: Removed `onAddToPlaylist`, `onLike`, and `isLiked` props that weren't being used
- **Focused functionality**: Now only handles the core play/pause functionality
- **Removed unused imports**: Cleaned up MoreHorizontal, Heart, Plus icons and dropdown menu components

### 5. MusicPlayer Component Cleanup
- **Removed fake interaction buttons**: Eliminated shuffle, repeat, and like buttons that had no real functionality
- **Simplified state management**: Removed local state for `isLiked`, `isShuffled`, and `repeatMode`
- **Core functionality only**: Now only provides essential play/pause/skip controls
- **Removed unused imports**: Cleaned up Shuffle, Repeat, Heart icons

## Result

The frontend is now:
- **More focused**: Only shows features that actually work
- **Less confusing**: No more dummy buttons that don't do anything
- **Cleaner UI**: Simplified interface without fake elements
- **Better UX**: Users won't click on non-functional buttons
- **Easier to maintain**: Less code to manage and fewer potential confusion points

2. **Subscription upgrade**: Working subscription flow
3. **Authentication**: Sign in/out functionality
4. **Volume control**: Working volume slider
5. **Progress tracking**: Time display and seeking
